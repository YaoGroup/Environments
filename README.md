## Environments
This repo provides the environments suitable for running our codes on Della-gpu, group workstation, and your local machine

environment-cluster-tf24.yml: For running our code using Tensorflow 2.4 on Della-gpu
environment-wokstation-tf24.yml: For running our code using Tensorflow 2.4 on our workstation
environment-wokstation-tf115.yml: For running our code using Tensorflow 1.15 on our workstation
environment-wokstation-tf114.yml: For running the origional PINN code in Raissi (2019). It uses tf.contrib and thus too old for Tensorflow 1.15
environment-win.yml: For running our code using Tensorflow 2.5 on a personal windows computer
environment-osx.yml: For running our code using Tensorflow 2.4 on a personal mac computer
