# Environments
This repo provides the environments suitable for running our codes on Della-gpu, group workstation, and your local machine


environment-wokstation-tf24.yml: For running Tensorflow 2.4 on our workstation
environment-wokstation-tf115.yml: For running Tensorflow 1.15 on our workstation
environment-wokstation-tf114.yml: For running the origional PINN code in Raissi (2019). It uses tf.contrib and thus too old for Tensorflow 1.15
